Hello and welcome to this lecture.

00:02.550 --> 00:08.880
And in this lecture we'll go ahead and learn how we can set the background image for our website using

00:08.980 --> 00:09.790
CCS.

00:10.080 --> 00:16.470
So what we can actually do is that just as we can set a background color to our Web site we can also

00:16.470 --> 00:19.340
actually go ahead and set up a bag and image as well.

00:19.470 --> 00:25.230
So in order to set up a back and own image we need to understand where exactly that image is going to

00:25.230 --> 00:26.070
come from.

00:26.070 --> 00:29.800
So for example let's see if you're building a real web site.

00:29.850 --> 00:34.420
And let's see if you want to add a background image to that particular Web site.

00:34.500 --> 00:41.970
What you have to do is that you have to go ahead and put that image up onto your cell wall because obviously

00:42.060 --> 00:47.430
unless and until that image is president on your server you won't be able to add that image to your

00:47.430 --> 00:48.150
Web site.

00:48.570 --> 00:55.110
So the image is actually a resource which is going to be required by your Web site and henceforth that

00:55.110 --> 00:58.350
resos should actually be present on your server.

00:58.920 --> 01:01.950
So right now we are not working with so was yet.

01:01.950 --> 01:06.300
So how exactly are you going to add image to our Web site.

01:06.310 --> 01:12.780
So one interesting thing which you can do here is that even if the image is not hosted on your so you

01:12.780 --> 01:15.990
can use images which are hosted on someone else's world.

01:16.020 --> 01:20.950
So for example you can simply go ahead and search for an image on the Internet.

01:21.060 --> 01:28.290
And once you have the path of that particular image you can use the path of that image to add it up

01:28.290 --> 01:29.620
onto your site.

01:29.670 --> 01:32.910
So let's see how exactly that thing is going to work out.

01:32.910 --> 01:39.370
So let me just open up Google and we're actually going to search for an image.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.500
So simply go ahead and search for.

01:41.720 --> 01:44.980
Let's say the Web site

01:47.930 --> 01:49.640
backdown.

01:50.130 --> 01:54.450
So when you go ahead and search for a website background you are going to get a bunch of options in

01:54.450 --> 01:54.720
here.

01:54.780 --> 02:03.030
So simply go to images and let's say if you want to choose any particular image so most probably choose

02:03.030 --> 02:07.190
an image which actually suits your website's resolution.

02:07.200 --> 02:11.850
So I guess Google 80 by 720 would be a nice resolution.

02:11.850 --> 02:15.790
So now you simply have to right click and open this image in a new tab.

02:16.140 --> 02:22.320
So as soon as you open this image in a new tab this particular address which you get right here is nothing

02:22.350 --> 02:29.630
but the address of this image on the Internet which means that this particular image is actually presentable.

02:29.640 --> 02:37.410
So at this particular location which means we can simply copy this address and we can use this image

02:37.440 --> 02:42.960
as and when you want but just make sure that the image which you're using is not copyright protected

02:42.990 --> 02:45.810
and you do have the right to use that image.

02:45.810 --> 02:48.180
So this is just for the sake of an example.

02:48.360 --> 02:51.920
I'm just going to go ahead show you how exactly this works.

02:51.930 --> 02:58.790
So now once we have that image in order to add that image as a background of whole Web site the Cecils

02:58.800 --> 03:02.830
property which will be using is the background image property.

03:03.090 --> 03:13.000
So in order to add that a boy here I can simply type in background image and in here we just need to

03:13.000 --> 03:14.320
specify the order.

03:14.410 --> 03:21.180
So we type and you are stating that we are going to add in a are in here and give double quotes over

03:21.200 --> 03:22.540
here and just paste.

03:22.590 --> 03:29.220
You are liar which you have copied pasted away here and the statement with the semi-colon.

03:29.240 --> 03:29.870
See the code.

03:29.890 --> 03:31.870
And then you get to go.

03:31.870 --> 03:39.640
So now if you go back to your website and hit refresh now you have this particular image as your background.

03:39.740 --> 03:45.620
So that's how you can actually go ahead and set up a background image for your web site but just make

03:45.620 --> 03:49.770
sure that any image which you select is going to be of a proper size.

03:49.970 --> 03:55.030
Because what happens is that let's say if you select some other image which is of a lesser size.

03:55.280 --> 04:02.120
So let's say we choose this particular image which is 600 by 350 600 by 350.

04:02.150 --> 04:07.400
Emerge is only going to go with a certain portion of your website and the rest of the part of your website

04:07.490 --> 04:09.490
is going to be empty.

04:09.620 --> 04:15.170
So just make sure that whatever emerges you're choosing actually fits your monitor screen or your computer

04:15.170 --> 04:17.440
screen and you should be good to go.

04:17.870 --> 04:19.420
So that's it for this lecture.

04:19.430 --> 04:24.520
Hopefully you guys were able to understand how to add background images using scissors.

04:24.590 --> 04:28.660
So thank you very much for watching and I'll see you guys next time.

04:28.970 --> 04:29.440
Thank you.
