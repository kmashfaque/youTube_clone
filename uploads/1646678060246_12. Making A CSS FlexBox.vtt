00:00.360 --> 00:06.600
Hello and welcome to this lecture and then this lecture will go ahead and create a simple flex box and

00:06.600 --> 00:10.840
see how elements are actually going to be laid out in a flex box.

00:11.060 --> 00:14.610
So before learning about flex box so creating a flex box.

00:14.610 --> 00:20.050
Let's first go ahead and understand how developments are actually placed in a normal container.

00:20.400 --> 00:26.880
So in the in the previous lecture you have actually learned about Glass and how they can be used to

00:26.910 --> 00:30.660
basically separate have separate sections on a web page.

00:30.720 --> 00:33.550
So let's not go ahead and create a div class over here.

00:33.600 --> 00:38.140
So let's name this class as let's say container.

00:38.400 --> 00:43.700
And what we will do is that we'll go ahead and place some items or elements into this div.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.780
So those actually become the developments.

00:45.780 --> 00:51.480
So what I'll do here is that I simply go ahead and create some classes over here.

00:51.510 --> 00:54.660
So let's say we have you your here.

00:56.340 --> 00:59.870
So let's see this is our first development.

00:59.910 --> 01:01.690
Let's create another one.

01:01.760 --> 01:09.100
Class this is going to be let's say B and let's have the third one and let's call it a seat.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.420
So the Class C.

01:11.480 --> 01:16.700
So once we have these three elements let's actually go ahead and give it some kind of styling so that

01:16.730 --> 01:19.760
we should be able to see those elements on our Web page.

01:19.760 --> 01:25.370
So what we are doing here is that we are basically having a look at how exactly these developments are

01:25.370 --> 01:28.840
going to look like when you place them in a container.

01:29.090 --> 01:31.980
So let's go ahead and style these elements up.

01:32.060 --> 01:35.900
So let's tile them individually and let's give them different colors.

01:36.020 --> 01:45.270
So we'll type in let's say the minimum of this is going to be 150 pixels and let's say the height is

01:45.270 --> 01:47.930
going to be 150 pixels as well.

01:48.840 --> 01:54.480
And what I will do here is that I'll copy the same property for all the three boxes over here.

01:54.480 --> 01:58.650
So this is going to be B and this one is going to be c..

01:59.220 --> 02:02.060
So we are essentially having some boxes over here.

02:02.490 --> 02:08.260
And in order to identify these boxes what we really do is that we will have a different background color

02:08.310 --> 02:09.910
for each one of them.

02:09.960 --> 02:18.310
So the background color for this one is going to be let's say blue let's say the Baggott on Carlo for

02:18.310 --> 02:22.960
this one is going to be the red background color is red.

02:23.020 --> 02:26.970
And let's say the background color for the final one is going to be green.

02:27.040 --> 02:31.930
So the background color for this is going to be green.

02:32.410 --> 02:32.710
OK.

02:32.710 --> 02:38.110
So now once we have them let's actually go ahead and see how these elements are going to look like in

02:38.110 --> 02:39.260
this container.

02:39.670 --> 02:45.760
So if you go back over here hit refresh as you could see this is how the elements are actually stacked.

02:45.760 --> 02:50.590
So you have specified the minimum with 150 but I think we have zoomed in over here.

02:50.590 --> 02:53.490
So let me just zoom out a little bit.

02:53.680 --> 03:00.220
And as you could see as we have the elements stacked up over here these are actually going to be displayed

03:00.220 --> 03:00.790
like that.

03:00.820 --> 03:03.830
And this is actually because we are using a normal container.

03:03.910 --> 03:07.800
So now let's learn what happens when we actually use a flex container.

03:08.110 --> 03:13.960
So in order to make any container or flex what we have to do is that we have to simply go ahead and

03:13.960 --> 03:16.160
you have to set the property for that container.

03:16.300 --> 03:20.850
So if you want to set the property for the container we use that last select of container.

03:20.980 --> 03:22.770
So not container.

03:23.560 --> 03:27.490
And that's actually going to have a simple property which is display.

03:27.490 --> 03:33.990
And we said this display property to flex and where you want to use a flex container or flex box.

03:34.030 --> 03:39.460
So when we do that and when we go back we're here and now if we hit refresh as you could see now you

03:39.460 --> 03:45.040
can see that all those elements are actually now placed in this particular fashion.

03:45.040 --> 03:50.440
That is they are not any longer stacked on top of each other and said they are actually placed right

03:50.440 --> 03:52.170
next to each other.

03:52.180 --> 03:59.440
Now if you want to see where exactly the container is you can simply go ahead and you can give the container

03:59.440 --> 04:00.640
a particular color.

04:00.970 --> 04:03.750
So let's just give this a yellow color.

04:03.760 --> 04:12.700
So what I will do here is that I just type in background color and I'll just assign it to your local

04:12.750 --> 04:13.470
low.

04:13.600 --> 04:17.240
So now you'll be able to see exactly the kind in place.

04:17.290 --> 04:23.650
So if we hit refresh as it could see this thing is our entire container and these items actually arranged

04:23.650 --> 04:25.660
into that container side by side.

04:25.660 --> 04:31.390
Now what do you still want to make it stack on top of each other from top to bottom and sort of stacking

04:31.390 --> 04:32.270
it like that.

04:32.320 --> 04:38.590
One way is that you can go ahead and you can change the display type of this thing by simply removing

04:38.590 --> 04:39.090
it all.

04:39.110 --> 04:43.520
Either way is that you can use a property which is called less flex direction.

04:43.570 --> 04:46.880
So as I mentioned the flex actually has two axis.

04:46.900 --> 04:48.660
The main axis on the cross axis.

04:48.700 --> 04:54.610
So right now by default the main axis which we have is actually going to be the rule.

04:54.640 --> 04:57.010
So the elements are going to be stacked in a row.

04:57.010 --> 05:03.420
But when you do find the axes to be a column those elements are now going to be stacked top to bottom.

05:03.430 --> 05:06.660
So let's go ahead and add a Flagstad action proper to here.

05:06.710 --> 05:13.330
So Flex direction and now if we said to do column let's see what exactly happens.

05:13.330 --> 05:18.190
So then we go back over here hit refresh as it could see now the elements are going to be arranged in

05:18.190 --> 05:20.500
a top to bottom fashion.

05:20.500 --> 05:27.010
Now the reason why the elements actually spanning the entire thing is because we have set the minimum

05:27.220 --> 05:29.040
property for them.

05:29.080 --> 05:34.810
So if you actually to replace this minimum weight with let's say just with it's actually going to stop

05:34.810 --> 05:36.640
spending the entire space.

05:36.640 --> 05:41.860
So now if we go back over here and hit refresh as you could see this thing is not going to spend the

05:41.860 --> 05:48.760
entire space available to it what minimum means is that at least we should have a word which is these

05:48.760 --> 05:54.110
many pixels and it can extend as long as that container actually allows it to do.

05:54.370 --> 05:57.310
And that's why this actually is going to spend the entire world.

05:57.310 --> 05:58.780
Now let's do one thing over here.

05:58.810 --> 06:04.300
Let's actually get back to our code and change the flex direction.

06:04.300 --> 06:09.630
So by default when you don't specify any flex selection the direction is going to be wrong.

06:09.640 --> 06:13.050
And that's why the elements are going to be arranged in this fashion.

06:13.150 --> 06:17.700
So that's how you can actually make a simple flex container which we have made right here.

06:17.710 --> 06:24.460
So the simple method of making a flex container is that you simply make a of here and while styling

06:24.460 --> 06:29.650
the drive glass in CSSA you simply use display property here and set it to flex.

06:29.650 --> 06:32.710
And that's going to make your container of like Xbox.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.130
So that's it for this lecture.

06:34.150 --> 06:38.970
And in the next one we're actually going to learn about like glue and flex shrink.

06:38.980 --> 06:42.550
So thank you very much for watching and I'll see you guys next time.

06:42.730 --> 06:43.180
Thank you.
