00:00.090 --> 00:01.780
Hello and welcome to this lecture.

00:01.830 --> 00:06.770
And in this lecture we're going to learn something about CSSA Galo values.

00:06.960 --> 00:13.390
So right now we have actually designed this particular web page and we have used a few colors here.

00:13.590 --> 00:18.780
So what we have essentially done here is that if you open up this code we have specified the colors

00:18.780 --> 00:24.870
in the actual values by the actual names like orange red Popal blue and aqua.

00:24.870 --> 00:31.860
Now in reality what happens is that whatever you want to set the color for any HDMI element you can

00:31.890 --> 00:39.120
either name the color by a specific name or you can also use something which is called as an RGV value.

00:39.250 --> 00:45.540
So before we start discussing LGB rally let's actually go ahead and learn how we can give a background

00:45.540 --> 00:49.230
color to this particular Web site or this boy or webpage.

00:49.230 --> 00:55.290
So in order to give the background of both regular color and what we can do here is that we could use

00:55.320 --> 01:00.880
this particular body tag because the body of our HGA is nothing but the background.

01:00.900 --> 01:07.610
So what we can do is that in order to set the background color we have to actually modify the body tag.

01:07.620 --> 01:10.770
So let's actually go ahead to use the body Diago here.

01:11.220 --> 01:15.060
So this is actually the tax collector and let's specify the background color.

01:15.300 --> 01:22.200
So the background color of any HDMI element or basically any HDMI body can actually be said by using

01:22.200 --> 01:29.820
the property you would just call less background color so simply type and background hyphen color background

01:29.820 --> 01:35.670
dash color and you or you can actually simply specify a particular color and that color is going to

01:35.670 --> 01:37.460
be applied to your webpage.

01:37.680 --> 01:41.580
But in reality you can't actually use a particular color.

01:41.570 --> 01:48.450
Instead you have to use a combination of multiple colors or a particular shade of color because obviously

01:48.450 --> 01:51.890
we are not going to use these direct colors on our Web site.

01:51.920 --> 01:56.330
Sometimes we need to mix up those colors and use a combination of colors.

01:56.340 --> 02:02.150
Now there are actually thousands of colors and it's impossible to name each one of those colors.

02:02.280 --> 02:08.760
Hence what we do in order to solve this issue is that we have no specific way to define Kallos in terms

02:08.760 --> 02:10.650
of IGB values.

02:10.890 --> 02:17.310
So IGB values are nothing but the values for red and green and blue colors and every shade of a color

02:17.310 --> 02:22.480
is nothing but a combination of those three basic clothes which is red green and blue.

02:22.650 --> 02:28.890
So you can opt in any kind of color just by mixing these three colors in appropriate proportions and

02:28.890 --> 02:34.770
you may have your own color and redo the exact same thing in here in computers as well now a combination

02:34.830 --> 02:38.180
of IGB can give us any desired Colobus if you want.

02:38.400 --> 02:45.010
So instead of specifying the Coloe here in actual names we can actually specify the IGB value here.

02:45.090 --> 02:47.580
So we simply open IGB over here.

02:48.090 --> 02:54.030
And once you type this value you can add value for each one of those colors that is Oggi and beat.

02:54.300 --> 03:00.410
So the minimum value of a color is zero and the maximum value of a color is 255.

03:00.420 --> 03:07.440
So if you actually want to make this background color look blue you have zero value for red zero value

03:07.440 --> 03:10.530
for green and use 255 for blue.

03:10.560 --> 03:13.700
That's actually going to make the background completely blue.

03:13.710 --> 03:18.550
So if you go back over here hit refresh as you could see you now have a blue color.

03:18.780 --> 03:24.450
Now what exactly you will do if you want to use a shade of a color or a combination of color rather

03:24.450 --> 03:26.420
than using a specific color.

03:26.520 --> 03:32.430
So you simply go with this thing and this is going to give you a color picture where you can pick up

03:32.460 --> 03:33.920
any color which you want.

03:33.930 --> 03:39.410
So let's say you want to choose the shades of colors from these colors here.

03:39.660 --> 03:44.390
You can simply go here and you can also select any kind of shade which you want.

03:44.400 --> 03:53.170
So let's say if you want this particular color so the IGB values for this color 151 220 195.

03:53.210 --> 03:58.940
So when you go back save the code and if you hit refresh on this web page as you could see now you have

03:58.940 --> 04:00.930
a different set of color as your background.

04:00.950 --> 04:07.750
And this color does not have any name but instead it has something which is called as the IGB value.

04:07.880 --> 04:14.630
So you can use any values from 0 to 255 for each one of those red green and blue values and you will

04:14.630 --> 04:16.710
get your desired color which you want.

04:17.530 --> 04:22.070
Now we have already said the background color using this particular attribute.

04:22.090 --> 04:28.630
But you can also said the colors of beheadings paragraphs and other HGL elements using IGB.

04:28.630 --> 04:35.460
Now there is one more way of using IGB and that's basically call as GBM.

04:35.500 --> 04:40.030
So let's go ahead and understand what IGB It actually stands for.

04:40.270 --> 04:43.760
So the key in RGV stands for Alpha.

04:43.840 --> 04:51.070
So Alpha is basically nothing but the value for APCP that means how transparent you want to make your

04:51.230 --> 04:51.890
background.

04:52.090 --> 04:54.910
So the value of Alfar ranges from zero to 1.

04:54.910 --> 05:00.720
So when you specify Alpha as zero that means your background is going to be fully transparent.

05:00.970 --> 05:07.840
And when you specify the value of Alfar to be one that means your background is going to be not transparent

05:07.840 --> 05:08.620
at all.

05:08.620 --> 05:11.350
Now let's take a simple example to understand that.

05:11.350 --> 05:18.270
So let's say our Coloe values are zero for red 255 for green and zero for red.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.830
So that's actually going to give you a green color.

05:21.190 --> 05:24.910
So just to confirm we will actually see the code go back over here.

05:24.910 --> 05:28.220
Hit refresh as you can see we have a green color here.

05:28.300 --> 05:34.480
Now let's see if you want to make this background a little bit transparent so we can go ahead and add

05:34.480 --> 05:37.660
a fourth value here which is going to be the Alfar value.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.370
But before we do do that.

05:39.370 --> 05:43.370
We need to specify IDB Eloy here coma.

05:43.780 --> 05:49.020
And for the value of the Alfar value Bubel specify some particular number.

05:49.240 --> 05:53.860
So let's say we specify the Alpha as 0.5.

05:54.110 --> 05:59.290
And now if you go back over here and hit refresh as you could see you will notice a little bit of change

05:59.290 --> 06:03.480
in the background color and the background is now a little more transparent.

06:03.820 --> 06:07.220
So what if you actually said this value to zero.

06:07.470 --> 06:10.640
And that gives your background is going to be completely transparent.

06:10.680 --> 06:17.580
So if you hit refresh as you can see you will have no color at all because now you value for Alpha is

06:17.580 --> 06:20.640
zero which means it's completely transparent.

06:20.790 --> 06:24.540
So you can use Alfar for setting of the transparency as you want.

06:24.660 --> 06:30.480
So you can use either IGB or Oggi be evaluated as and when required.

06:30.480 --> 06:35.380
Now let's move on to another kind of color notation that's basically the hex values.

06:35.400 --> 06:41.050
So it can actually be specified using hex values or hexadecimal values as well.

06:41.280 --> 06:49.030
So if you want to actually specify close in hex value those values actually range from 0 to f f.

06:49.070 --> 06:51.470
So the Hick's model actually works this way.

06:51.680 --> 06:58.910
We use a hash or we're here first and then we have values for our two places for our two places for

07:00.290 --> 07:07.660
and two places for B that means you specify the value for it in hexadecimal here here value for green

07:07.670 --> 07:13.310
in hexadecimal or here and kilobyte useful blue in hexadecimal over here.

07:13.340 --> 07:19.700
So let's say if I type in so let's say I type and some random values over here let's say I type in 0

07:19.730 --> 07:23.060
0 1 do 1 4.

07:23.480 --> 07:26.810
So these are now hex values and the scale actually is black.

07:26.810 --> 07:32.620
So if I select any one of these values over here and you always need to make sure that you select hex

07:32.620 --> 07:33.410
values.

07:33.560 --> 07:40.010
So the same set of clothes which can be expressed using the IGB model can also be specified by using

07:40.010 --> 07:41.120
the hex values.

07:41.210 --> 07:43.550
So let's say you want to choose a shade of red.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.530
Simply go away here.

07:45.650 --> 07:47.380
Pick any desired shade you want.

07:47.390 --> 07:51.410
And this particular value is the hex value for this particular color.

07:51.650 --> 07:56.420
So now you could simply see the code go back over here and when you hit refresh as you could see now

07:56.420 --> 07:58.570
you have the Kaluga values over here.

07:59.000 --> 08:06.590
Now once we know about the IGB values and the hex values let's actually now go ahead and learn how exactly

08:06.590 --> 08:12.800
do you find proper sooted colors for your website because obviously we know how to choose colors but

08:12.830 --> 08:15.830
we don't yet know how to choose good looking colors.

08:15.860 --> 08:26.390
So in order to find good looking colors simply open up Google and type in CS's what DTL Gallo's and

08:26.390 --> 08:28.620
multiple sites should pop up right here.

08:28.730 --> 08:34.730
You can use any one of them which you want and what these sites do is that they provide you with the

08:34.730 --> 08:38.030
Coloe palette which you can actually use on your Web site.

08:38.180 --> 08:42.230
So let's say for example you like this particular color you think it looks pretty.

08:42.230 --> 08:49.820
You can simply copy this particular value go back to your code and simply piece this value in over here

08:50.490 --> 08:52.050
and you should be good to go.

08:52.140 --> 08:57.650
So now if you go back to your web page and hit refresh as you could see your web page looks much better

08:57.660 --> 09:02.850
ask compared to the previous one because now they actually provide you with a good set of colors to

09:02.850 --> 09:04.820
choose from for your website.

09:04.830 --> 09:11.310
So there are actually a lot of Web sites you don't need to specifically go and choose any one you can

09:11.310 --> 09:15.870
choose any desired one and they basically provide you with the shades of color along with their hecks

09:15.930 --> 09:18.220
RGV values.

09:18.260 --> 09:24.740
So that's it for this lecture and I hope you guys were able to learn how to set the colors for different

09:25.520 --> 09:31.290
elements in your H-G page using two different methods or three different Montfort's.

09:31.490 --> 09:37.030
The GBM method the IGB method and the hexadecimal or the hex values.

09:37.130 --> 09:42.620
And we have also learned how you can select or choose proper colors for your websites rather than choosing

09:42.620 --> 09:44.070
it by yourself.

09:44.090 --> 09:48.010
So that's it for this lecture and I'll see you guys in the next one.

09:48.170 --> 09:48.720
Thank you.
